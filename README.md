# Property price evaluation for Manhattan 2019
For MLC class 2019

## Data wrangling
<br> 

## Preprocessing
### Extremum filter
### Gaussian distribution Test
Chi-Square distribution
### Feature Selection
- Correlation: when two features have high correlation (>0.9), we drop one of the two features.
- P-value: remove irrelevant features

### Anomaly Detection
Isolate forest sacrifice 6% accuracy of the out of sample, but improve the robustness of the model by 11%.
### Standardize
### PCA / Whitening
### Train & Test random split
<br> 

## Model Selection
### Multivariate linear regression model
### Lasso
### Ridge
### Decision Tree
### Random forest
### SVM (missed)
### Bayesian Methods
### Bayesian Networks
### Gaussian Processes
### Clustering (optional)
<br> 

## Modeling
Develop models for different landuses.
- tuning
- K-Fold cross validation
